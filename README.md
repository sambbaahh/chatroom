<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

ChatRoom is my personal project, focusing on real-time communication. The application allows users to create and join rooms to engage in conversations with others in real-time. In ChatRoom, you can manage various aspects of communication and provide users with a space to share their thoughts and discuss different topics.

In the future, ChatRoom could incorporate several cool features to make it even better:

- **Persistent Data Storage**: We could implement database storage to keep data accessible between sessions and ensure it's not lost if the server goes down.

- **User Authentication**: Adding login mechanisms would allow users to log in and get a more personalized experience.

- **Expanded Features**: Enabling message and room editing and deletion would give users more control over their content and interactions.

- **Code Optimization**: Optimizing the code for better performance and user experience means faster load times and smoother operation.

By adding these features, ChatRoom could become a more versatile and user-friendly platform, offering enhanced capabilities and a more satisfying user experience.

In this personal project of mine, it's important to acknowledge that there may be bugs and areas where improvements are needed. _In the world of programming, as in any creative endeavour, the pursuit of flawless perfection can be a highly demanding endeavour._

4. Install project dependencies 
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the development server
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
#### Client Installation:
6. Open a new terminal window/tab
7. Navigate to the project's client directory
   ```sh
   cd client
